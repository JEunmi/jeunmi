                                    <p>he sees the spark in her grandson’s eye, his longing for more, and celebrates

                                    <p>Grandma knows that breaking a rule or two is part of growing up, and she’s a
                                        little too happy to look

                                    <p>Uncle Ugo,perhaps Luca’s strangest and most bizarre relative, emerges from the
                                        deepest part of the ocean to help Daniela and Lorenzo convince Luca of the
                                        dangers of the surface.</p>
                                    <p>Like Luca, Ugo once wondered about the world beyond the surface. </p>
                                    <p>But following a near-death encounter he learned to steer clear, relocating to his

                                        scary humans above the sea—just the way he likes it.</p>

                                filmmakers wanted to make this underwater world appealing—but not too appealing.
                                “This is where we meet Luca and learn pretty quickly how much he thinks about life
                                beyond the surface,” says Bianchi. “How do we make that location something that our
                                protagonist would want to leave?”</p>

                                but on the other hand, it’s every kid’s dream to have a place of their own where
